Heads up everyone! The new REVISED edition of the Free2View TV Project's Streaming TV Playlist is here!!

I have been busy revising the Free2View TV Playlist for 2021!! I know, it's September, and it is LATE 2021! lol, better late than never.

Here are the new URL's for the Free2View TV Project's Streaming TV Playlists: 

Free2View TV 2021: 
Master Playlist with new channel sets and old favorites:
- Samsung TV Plus w/EPG will be the backbone of the new revised playlist
- more EPG sources (several courtesy of Matt Huisman and other sources including the Free2View TV Project)
- EPG incorporated in all available categories including Canadian channels, CBC TV, etc.
- streamlined categories to eliminate deadwood, too many duplicated channels, etc. 
- duplicated channels are to a minimum, using streams from different sources/platforms where applicable.

UPDATE (10/11/21) Please note, a LOT of users are downloading the playlists and it was maxing out the 25 GB bandwidth limit in my OpenDrive server, so some users were reporting errors. With such small files, that means a big lot of you are enjoying this little project! So, I have set up up back up remote URL's in collaboration with @Sphinxroot and his team at the following Github: https://github.com/Sphinxroot/Free2ViewTV
Although I prefer using OpenDrive because of its privacy management, I upgraded the bandwidth limit of my OpenDrive server to 100 GB, so no one should get any errors (for now, unless a lot more people use Free2View TV lol, but otherwise everyone should be ok. At the very least, y'all can also add the Github Mirrors as backups. 

The OLD m3u documents will be updated with the new revised playlist and I will keep the old URL's live in my own github for a while longer, but please update your streaming players with the new remote URL's above to avoid any interruptions. I will eventually discontinue my Github server, but not for a while until everyone can transition to the new OpenDrive links (and the Github Mirrors as backups).

*** PLEASE NOTE *** 
Still working on migrating all the channels from the previous list to this revised version. I wanted to make sure that the new version's template was out there so that it can be built upon. The biggest criticisms was that there was too many categories, so a lot of channels can be incorporated into pre-existing groups and I wanted to get the basic framework done. This is the result of the work.

All previous Github versions of the playlist will be updated with the new revisions and the documents will remain live for a while longer, but I urge everyone to update their players with the new URL's. Those using Perfect Player, you can get an updated Backup file with all the new revisions on the home-base of the Free2View TV Project, our blog page here: https://thefrugalstreamer.blogspot.com/p/free2viewtvpage1.html

If there are any of your channels that are missing, open up an Issue in our github and I will get to it ASAP
